# hello-world
A hello to the world from Brazil!

My name is Gabriela Nogueira. I'm 32 years old and I live in Brazil with my son, Liam. He is 5 years old and a really happy boy. We lived in Belgium for a time. I confess I consider Belgium more like my home than Brazil, even though I was not born there. 
I speak Portuguese as mother language, but I also speak Dutch and English.
I am dreaming about becoming a programmer for a while but I didn't have the time or the energy for that. Now that I can do it I realize is not easy, yet amazing. I want to make good use of everything I learn here and I won't give up, even if it takes longer than expected
